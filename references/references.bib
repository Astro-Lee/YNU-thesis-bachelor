    abstract = "{We present a large, homogeneous catalogue of molecular clouds within 4 kpc from the Sun at low Galactic latitudes (|b| \\&lt; 10°) with unprecedented accurate distance determinations. Based on the 3D dust reddening map and estimates of colour excesses and distances of over 32 million stars presented in Chen et al., we have identified 567 dust/molecular clouds with a hierarchical structure identification method and obtained their distance estimates by a dust model fitting algorithm. The typical distance uncertainty is less than 5 per cent. As far as we know, this is the first large catalogue of molecular clouds in the Galactic plane with distances derived in a direct manner. The clouds are seen to lie along the Sagittarius, Local and Perseus Arms. In addition to the known structures, we propose the existence of a possible spur, with a pitch angle of about 34°, connecting the Local and the Sagittarius Arms in the fourth quadrant. We have also derived the physical properties of those molecular clouds. The distribution of cloud properties in different parameter spaces agrees grossly with the previous results. Our cloud sample is an ideal starting point to study the concentration of dust and gas in the solar vicinity and their star formation activities.}",
